You have to have 

"dbus-daemon-1 --session"

process running in you system to work it propertly.

you can run it with while you login with script like this:

if test -z "$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS" ; then
  ## if not found, launch a new one 
  eval `dbus-launch --sh-syntax --exit-with-session`
  echo "D-BUS per-session daemon address is: $DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS"
fi
