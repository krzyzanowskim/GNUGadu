AFTER 2.0:
 - register new account (tlen)
 - current status description text somewhere

Later:
 - applying theme should refresh everything (it's not doing that for menubar) (GUI)
 - memory leaks audit (all)
 - conference (jabber)

protocol plugins load before the rest (problem with dbus -  have to me loaded before protocols to
handle all of them not only the first one... don't know why.. signal go but do not show window... seems
gui plugin problem)
